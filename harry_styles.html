Harry Styles is arguably the best member of One Direction. In my opinion, he was the glue that held the band together. (Until it didn't...)</div><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">Who is Harry Styles?</h2>
      <p class="p">Harry Styles, born on February 1, 1994, in Redditch, England, quickly became a standout member of One Direction with his distinctive voice and charismatic personality. Harry gained a massive following early on in the band's lifetime, contributing greatly to their widespread popularity. His natural stage presence and ability to connect with fans helped solidify One Direction's place as one of the biggest boy bands in the world. While his music is the main reason for his fame, he is also well known as an icon of fashion and inclusivity.</p>
      
    </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">What Did One Direction Gain from Harry?</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Harry played a key role as one of the lead vocalists in One Direction. His strong vocals and dynamic stage presence made him an instant heartthrob to One Direction fans. Harry's fashion sense and bold personality added a distinctiveness that set the group apart from other boy bands. Additionally, as One Direction matured, he became more involved in songwriting, and is credited on quite a few of the band's biggest hits.</p>
    </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">What Do People Think About Harry?</h2>
      <p class="p">Harry Styles is widely regarded as one of the most beloved figures in contemporary music. As aforementioned, he is a huge activist for inclusivity which definitely makes him popular with younger generations. Since the band's hiatus, Harry has successfully carved out a solo career and further enhanced his reputation as an artist. Fans appreciate his willingness to experiment with different musical styles and his ability to connect with them on a personal level.</p>
      
    </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">Could Harry Make It as a Solo Artist?</h2>
      
      <p class="p">Harry Styles has the most successful solo career of all the One Direction boys, and this statement is not even remotely arguable. With three solo albums, all of which spent their fair share of time on the Billboard Top Charts, Harry became even more of a music phenomenon post-1D. He is currently taking a break from the public eye, but I have no doubt that his hype will resume as soon as he steps back into the spotlight.</p>
