While Liam Payne is definitely no Harry Styles, he was still a very important member of One Direction.</div><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">Who is Liam Payne?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Liam Payne, born on August 29, 1993, in Wolverhampton, England, stood out in One Direction for his strong vocals and natural leadership qualities. Originally auditioning for <em class="ph i">The X Factor</em> in 2008 before joining the band in 2010, Liam brought a level of maturity and stability to the group. His consistent performances and ability to take on complex harmonies made him a key part of One Direction's success.</p>
        </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">What Did One Direction Gain from Liam?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Liam's vocals are recognized and adored by One Direction fans all over the world. Liam also contributed to songwriting for the band and is credited on some of the band's biggest hits. Whereas Harry is known for his powerful ad-libs rising over the chorus of the other boys, Liam is known for his strong harmonizing skills. There's nary a successful boy band without a strong harmonizer amongst the group. More recently, however, Liam has been publicly denouncing his time in the band. Whether he's being truthful or not, he is making a lot of unbased claims that are likely the reason the band will never reunite.</p>
        </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">What Do People Think About Liam?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Since the hiatus, Liam has a bumpy ride in the spotlight. His solo career was not a total failure, but it was also not a monumental success. Off the top of my head, I know one song that he has released as a solo artist and unfortunately I cannot say that I enjoy it. As far as I know, public perception of Liam Payne has recently been on the decline. The aforementioned unbased claims have gone viral on social media, and a lot of fans of the band believe Liam's accusations solidified the band never getting back together.</p>
        </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">Could Liam Make It as a Solo Artist?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Unfortunately, it does not seem that Liam has potential as a solo artist. Despite him starting out as One Direction's leading man (he was promptly replaced by Harry), he does not seem to have the star factor that is required to make it in today's world. His first solo release, "Strip That Down", was more of a joke to the masses than a serious attempt at a career in music. It's never easy to say, but Liam Payne does not have my seal of approval.</p>
