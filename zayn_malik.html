<section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">Who is Zayn Malik?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Zayn Malik was born on January 12, 1993, in Bradford, England. Zayn was known for his incredible vocal range and mysterious persona during his time in One Direction. He was often seen as the quieter member, but his powerful vocals made a significant impact on their biggest hits. In 2015, Zayn left the band to pursue a solo career, where he further explored his artistic individuality and ultimately caused  the indefinite (but seemingly permanent) hiatus of One Direction.</p>
        </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">What Did One Direction Gain from Zayn?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Zayn  brought a unique sound to One Direction with his incredible vocal range and distinct R&amp;B influences. His smooth falsetto and ability to hit high notes  gave One Direction a depth and edge that set them apart from the typical boy band sound.  Though he wasn't  involved in songwriting during his time with the group, Zayn's powerful voice and mysterious persona contributed greatly to One Direction's appeal and success. However, Zayn's departure from the group in 2015 contributed to a significant divide amongst the band and, in my expert opinion, likely caused the eventual split of the band.</p>
        </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">What Do People Think About Zayn?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Public perception of Zayn Malik has been more complex compared to his former bandmates. During his time in One Direction, he was admired for his quiet, mysterious personality and stunning vocal talent. However, after his departure from the band, Zayn was faced with both praise and criticism. While many fans respected his decision to explore his artistic individuality, others were not pleased by his departure. His solo music is moody and much more R&amp;B geared than that of One Direction, has attracted a new audience, though Zayn's  private nature and less frequent public appearances have  made him seem distant. Regardless, his talent and distinctiveness remain widely recognized.</p>
        </section><section class="section"><h2 class="title h4 text-secondary">Could Zayn Make It as a Solo Artist?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Zayn Malik has definitely proven his potential as a solo artist. After leaving One Direction, he quickly established himself with a fresh, R&amp;B-inspired album that steered attention away from his boy band roots. His impressive vocals and willingness to experiment with different styles have earned him respect in the industry and a solid fanbase. He tends to keep a lower profile compared to his former bandmates, but his creativity and unique artistic direction continue to resonate with listeners.</p>
